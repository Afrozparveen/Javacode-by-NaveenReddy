1. Type Casting::
Type casting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another explicitly by the programmer. In Java, there are two types of casting:

public class TypeCastingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Widening (Implicit) Casting (small size to large size)
        int num = 100;
        double doubleNum = num;  // int to double

        System.out.println("Widening Casting:");
        System.out.println("int value: " + num);
        System.out.println("double value: " + doubleNum);

        // Narrowing (Explicit) Casting (large size to small size)
        double decimal = 99.99;
        int intValue = (int) decimal;  // double to int

        System.out.println("\nNarrowing Casting:");
        System.out.println("double value: " + decimal);
        System.out.println("int value (after casting): " + intValue);
    }
}
OUTPUT:::::::::::::::

Widening Casting:
int value: 100
double value: 100.0

Narrowing Casting:
double value: 99.99
int value (after casting): 99


2. Type Conversion
Type conversion occurs automatically when a value of one type is assigned to another type, provided that there is no data loss. This happens mostly in arithmetic operations.

Example of Type Conversion:

public class TypeConversionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int intVal = 50;
        double doubleVal = intVal;  // int is automatically converted to double

        System.out.println("Type Conversion Example:");
        System.out.println("int value: " + intVal);
        System.out.println("double value: " + doubleVal);
    }
}
Output:

Type Conversion Example:
int value: 50
double value: 50.0
This happens because double has a larger range than int, so Java automatically converts int to double without requiring explicit casting.

3. Type Promotion
Type promotion occurs automatically when performing operations on smaller data types like byte, short, or char. Java promotes these types to int before performing operations.

Example of Type Promotion:

public class TypePromotionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        byte byteVal1 = 10;
        byte byteVal2 = 20;

        // Automatic promotion to int
        int sum = byteVal1 + byteVal2;

        System.out.println("Type Promotion Example:");
        System.out.println("Sum of bytes (promoted to int): " + sum);

        char char1 = 'A';  // ASCII value of 'A' is 65
        char char2 = 'B';  // ASCII value of 'B' is 66

        // Automatic promotion to int
        int charSum = char1 + char2;

        System.out.println("Sum of characters (ASCII values): " + charSum);
    }
}
Output:

Type Promotion Example:
Sum of bytes (promoted to int): 30
Sum of characters (ASCII values): 131

Here, byteVal1 and byteVal2 are byte types, but their sum is automatically promoted to int.
Similarly, char1 and char2 are characters, but their ASCII values are used in the addition, promoting them to int.
Summary of Differences
Concept	Definition	Example
Type Casting	Manually converting a variable from one type to another.	(int) 99.99 converts double to int.
Type Conversion	Automatic conversion between compatible types (widening conversion).	int x = 10; double y = x; (int â†’ double)
Type Promotion	Automatic promotion of smaller data types (byte, short, char) to int in expressions.	byte b1 = 10, b2 = 20; int sum = b1 + b2;
