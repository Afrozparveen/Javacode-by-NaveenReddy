Why Do We Need an Array in Java?
  An array is a fundamental data structure in Java that allows us to store multiple values of the same type under a single variable name. It is needed for efficient data storage, organization, and retrieval.

1. Storing Multiple Values
  Without arrays, we would have to create multiple variables for storing multiple values of the same type.

Example (Without Arrays):

int num1 = 10;
int num2 = 20;
int num3 = 30;
If we have hundreds of values, this approach is impractical.

Example (With Arrays):

int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

EXAMPLE:::::::::::::::::::::::::
int i=5;
int j=6;
int k=7;
int num[]= {5,6,7};
int num[]=new int[4];
